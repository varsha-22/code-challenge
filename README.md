## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To be able to run this repository on your machine, you will need to have the following installed:
- NodeJS (> 12)

### Installing Dependencies

To install all needed Node and React dependencies, you can run:

```
npm install or npm i

### Copy env variable file

The code rests upon certain environemt variables that are expected to be declared inside a `.env` file.

Those variables are defined (with sensible defaults) in `.env.sample`, so you can copy that file as such:

```
### Database

You can either use a local or remote MongoDB to setup a database.

## Development

To run server and client code independently you can run by using:
```
npm run start or npm start
```
makes sure you will run this command inside that directory
